      <p>
        <em>The Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is a long-range, high-altitude, Mach 3+
        strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed and manufactured by the
        American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. It was operated by both
        the United States Air Force (USAF) and NASA.</em>

        The SR-71 was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12
        reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's Skunk Works
        division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was
        responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of
        the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first
        aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar cross-section. At one
        point, a bomber variant of the aircraft was under consideration, before
        the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for
        the reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a
        side-looking airborne radar, and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both
        longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it to hold more fuel as well
        as a two-seat cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to
        lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay, who
        preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS
        (Reconnaissance). The aircraft was introduced to operational service in
        January 1966.
